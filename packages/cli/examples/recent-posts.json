What I‚Äôd like to achieve is something simple: üëâ When I run out of tokens on Cloud, I want to **switch seamlessly to GLM** (or another compatible model) without having to rewrite configs or change my codebase drastically. Kind of like a ‚Äúhot swap‚Äù between providers/models. I imagine a flow like: 1. Call ‚Üí Cloud Code (default). 2. If quota exhausted ‚Üí switch to GLM. 3. (DESIRE) Keep conversation/context consistent across providers. Curious if anyone has tried this hybrid approach ‚Äî or if I‚Äôm overcomplicating things and there‚Äôs a simpler pattern I‚Äôm missing.

I'm happy to say the Josh (Qix) the maintainer that was compromised agreed to sit down with me and discuss his experience, it was a very candid conversation but one I think was important to have. Below are some of the highlight and takeaways from the conversation, since the “how could this happen?” question is still circulating. **Was MFA on the account?** “There was definitely MFA… but timed one-time passwords are not phishing resistant. They can be man in the middle. There’s no cryptographic checks, no domain association, nothing like U2F would have.” The attackers used a fake NPM login flow and captured his TOTP, allowing them to fully impersonate him. Josh called out not enabling phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/U2F) as his biggest technical mistake. **The scale of the blast radius** Charlie (our researcher) spotted the issue while triaging suspicious packages: “First I saw the debug package… then I saw chalk and error-ex… and I knew a significant portion of the JS ecosystem would be impacted.” Wiz later reported that **99% of cloud environments used at least one affected package**. “The fact it didn’t do anything was the bullet we dodged. It ran in CI/CD, on laptops, servers, enterprise machines. It could have done anything.” Wiz also reported that 10% of cloud environments they analyzed had the malware inside them. There were some 'hot takes' on the internet that, in fact this was not a big deal and some said it was a win for security. Josh shared that this was not a win and the only reason we got away with it was because how ineffective the attackers were. The malicious packages were downloaded 2.5 million times in the 2 hour window they were live. **Ecosystem-level shortcomings** Josh was frank about registry response times and missing safeguards: “There was a huge process breakdown during this attack with NPM. Extremely slow to respond. No preemptive ‘switch to U2F’ push despite billions of downloads. I had no recourse except filing a ticket through their public form.\" Josh also gave some advice for anyone going through this in the future which is to be open and transparent, the internet largely agreed Josh handled this in the best way possible (short of not getting phished in the first place ) “If you screw up, own it. In open source, being transparent and immediate saves a lot of people’s time and money. Vulnerability (the human kind) goes a long way.”","authorId":"Advocatemack","updatedAt":"2025-09-12T18:24:59.722Z","metadata":{"name":"t3_1nf6df3","permalink":"/r/programming/comments/1nf6df3/i_got_pwned_npm_maintainer_of_chalk_debug_speaks/","domain":"youtube.com","is_self":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit":"programming","ups":48,"downs":0}},{"id":"1nf4mn4","title":"Hiii test upvote everyone","author":"cutewithissues","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/test/comments/1nf4mn4/hiii_test_upvote_everyone/","score":6,"commentCount":5,"platform":"reddit","createdAt":"2025-09-12T14:23:54.000Z","content":null,"authorId":"cutewithissues","metadata":{"name":"t3_1nf4mn4","permalink":"/r/test/comments/1nf4mn4/hiii_test_upvote_everyone/","domain":"self.test","is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","subreddit":"test","ups":6,"downs":0}},{"id":"1nesqco","title":"The Challenge of Maintaining Curl","author":"iamkeyur","url":"https://lwn.net/Articles/1034966/","score":251,"commentCount":82,"platform":"reddit","createdAt":"2025-09-12T03:26:40.000Z","content":null,"authorId":"iamkeyur","updatedAt":"2025-09-12T18:24:59.722Z","metadata":{"name":"t3_1nesqco","permalink":"/r/programming/comments/1nesqco/the_challenge_of_maintaining_curl/","domain":"lwn.net","is_self":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit":"programming","ups":251,"downs":0}},{"id":"1nesp2g","title":"Floating Point Visually Explained","author":"iamkeyur","url":"https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/","score":140,"commentCount":18,"platform":"reddit","createdAt":"2025-09-12T03:24:47.000Z","content":null,"authorId":"iamkeyur","updatedAt":"2025-09-12T18:24:59.722Z","metadata":{"name":"t3_1nesp2g","permalink":"/r/programming/comments/1nesp2g/floating_point_visually_explained/","domain":"fabiensanglard.net","is_self":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit":"programming","ups":140,"downs":0}},{"id":"18da1zl","title":"Some test commands","author":"PitchforkAssistant","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/test/comments/18da1zl/some_test_commands/","score":46,"commentCount":2070,"platform":"reddit","createdAt":"2023-12-08T00:29:02.000Z","content":"Command | Description -------|----------- `!cqs` | Get your current [Contributor Quality Score](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/16is6dh/contributor_quality_score_available_to_all/). `!ping` | pong `!autoremove` | Any post or comment containing this command will automatically be removed. `!remove` | Replying to your own post with this will cause it to be removed.

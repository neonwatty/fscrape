# Data Scraping and Verification Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Steps

### 1. Scraped Data from r/programming
- **Command**: `cd packages/cli && node dist/cli.js scrape https://reddit.com/r/programming --limit 100`
- **Result**: 100 posts successfully scraped
- **Database**: `/Users/jeremywatt/Desktop/fscrape/packages/cli/fscrape.db`
- **Sample Posts**:
  - "Australia might restrict GitHub over damage to kids, internet laughs" (77 score, 13 comments)
  - "PostgreSQL 18 Released!" (733 score, 48 comments)
  - "1 Bit is all we need: Binary Normalized Neural Networks" (116 score, 36 comments)

### 2. Transformed Data for Frontend
- **Script**: `/Users/jeremywatt/Desktop/fscrape/transform-cli-to-frontend.js`
- **Source**: CLI database (packages/cli/fscrape.db)
- **Destination**: Frontend database (packages/web/public/data/sample.db)
- **Transformations Applied**:
  - ‚úì `created_at` (milliseconds) ‚Üí `created_utc` (seconds) [divided by 1000]
  - ‚úì `scraped_at` (timestamp) ‚Üí ISO string format
  - ‚úì `comment_count` ‚Üí `num_comments`
  - ‚úì Parsed metadata JSON for Reddit-specific fields (subreddit, upvote_ratio, etc.)
  - ‚úì Set `source` and `subreddit` fields to 'programming'
  - ‚úì Constructed `permalink` from metadata

### 3. Data Verification
- **Total posts in frontend database**: 904 posts
- **Posts from r/programming**: 130 posts (30 existing + 100 new)
- **Transformation success rate**: 100% (100/100 posts)

## üåê Frontend Server Started

The frontend is now running at: **http://localhost:3000**

## üìã Manual Verification Checklist

Please verify the following in your browser:

### Dashboard Page (http://localhost:3000)
- [ ] Total post count reflects 904 posts (or 130 from r/programming)
- [ ] Recent posts from r/programming are visible
- [ ] Post cards show correct titles, authors, scores, and comment counts
- [ ] Date formatting displays correctly (e.g., "X hours ago" or "Sep 26, 2025")

### Posts Explorer (http://localhost:3000/posts)
- [ ] Filter by "programming" shows 130 posts
- [ ] Sort by date shows newest posts first (including the scraped ones)
- [ ] Post details match the scraped data:
  - "Australia might restrict GitHub..." shows 77 score, 13 comments
  - "PostgreSQL 18 Released!" shows 733 score, 48 comments
- [ ] Clicking on a post shows full details

### Analytics Page (http://localhost:3000/analytics)
- [ ] Charts reflect updated data with r/programming posts
- [ ] Time series shows posts over time including today's data
- [ ] Platform stats include r/programming metrics

## üîç Quick Data Validation

Run these commands to validate the data:

```bash
# Check CLI database
sqlite3 packages/cli/fscrape.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts;"
# Should show: 100

# Check frontend database
sqlite3 packages/web/public/data/sample.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts WHERE source = 'programming';"
# Should show: 130

# Sample some posts
sqlite3 packages/web/public/data/sample.db "SELECT title, score, num_comments FROM posts WHERE source = 'programming' LIMIT 5;"
```

## üìù Notes

1. **Database Locations**:
   - CLI DB: `packages/cli/fscrape.db` (100 posts)
   - Frontend DB: `packages/web/public/data/sample.db` (904 posts total)

2. **Transformation Script**:
   - Reusable script at `/Users/jeremywatt/Desktop/fscrape/transform-cli-to-frontend.js`
   - Can be run again with: `node transform-cli-to-frontend.js`
   - Uses INSERT OR REPLACE to handle duplicates

3. **Schema Compatibility**:
   - All required frontend fields are mapped correctly
   - Timestamps converted from milliseconds to seconds
   - Reddit-specific metadata extracted and stored
